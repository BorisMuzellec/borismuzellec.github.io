## About me ##

I am a post-doctoral researcher at [Sierra](https://www.di.ens.fr/sierra/), funded by [DIM Math Innov](https://www.dim-mathinnov.fr/en/postdoctoral-laureates-45.htm). I defended my PhD in October 2020 at ENSAE, where I worked under the supervision of [Marco Cuturi](http://marcocuturi.net).

## Research interests ##

My research is focused on applying tools from the optimal transport theory to machine learning, and vice-versa.

## News ##

I defended my thesis on the 26th of October: here are the [slides](https://borismuzellec.github.io/publications/slides_defense.pdf) of the defense, and the [manuscript](https://borismuzellec.github.io/publications/thesis_muzellec.pdf).

### Upcoming events ###

* [19/10/2021] I will give a talk on estimating smooth optimal transport using kernel sums-of-squares at [RIKEN AIP](https://c5dc59ed978213830355fc8978.doorkeeper.jp/events/127501). 

### Recent events ###

* [21/06/2021] New [Note on Optimizing Distributions using Kernel Mean Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09994). Joint work with [Francis Bach](https://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/) and [Alessandro Rudi](https://www.di.ens.fr/~rudi/).

* [17/06/2021] I have been awarded a [PhD Thesis Award](https://www.ip-paris.fr/en/news/three-phd-thesis-awards) from IP Paris!
