## About me ##

I am a data scientist at [Owkin](https://owkin.com), a French AI biotech company. Prior to that, I was a post-doctoral researcher at the [Sierra](https://www.di.ens.fr/sierra/) INRIA team. I defended my PhD in October 2020 at ENSAE, where I worked under the supervision of [Marco Cuturi](http://marcocuturi.net).

## Research interests ##

Within Owkin, my research lies at the intersection of federated learning and bioinformatics. During my PhD, I leveraged the closed form of OT between elliptical distributions, along with regularized approaches of OT, to make a few contributions towards helping OT theory overcome some of its computational and statistical drawbacks, and gain applicability in machine learning. Starting from my postdoc, I got interested in using kernel methods to design algorithms that alleviate the curse of dimensionality in OT between distributions with smooth densities.
