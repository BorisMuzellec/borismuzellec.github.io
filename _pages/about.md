## About me ##

I am a post-doctoral researcher at [Sierra](https://www.di.ens.fr/sierra/), funded by [DIM Math Innov](https://www.dim-mathinnov.fr/en/postdoctoral-laureates-45.htm). I defended my PhD in October 2020 at ENSAE, where I worked under the supervision of [Marco Cuturi](http://marcocuturi.net).

## Research interests ##

My research is focused on applying tools from the optimal transport theory to machine learning, and vice-versa. During my PhD, I leveraged the closed form of OT between elliptical distributions, along with regularized approaches of OT, to make a few contributions towards helping OT theory overcome some of its computational and statistical drawbacks, and gain applicability in machine learning. Starting from my postdoc, I got interested in using kernel methods to design algorithms that alleviate the curse of dimensionality in OT between distributions with smooth densities.
