I am currently a post-doctoral researcher at Inria, in the [Sierra](https://www.di.ens.fr/sierra/) team. I obtained my PhD at ENSAE, Institut Polytechnique de Paris, working under the supervision of [Marco Cuturi](http://marcocuturi.net). Before that, I got an engineering degree from École polytechnique and a Msc in Data Sciences from Université Paris-Saclay. My detailed CV can be found [here](https://borismuzellec.github.io/publications/CV_website.pdf).
