I am currently a data scientist at [Owkin](https://owkin.com), a French AI biotech company. Prior to that, I was a post-doctoral researcher at Inria, in the [Sierra](https://www.di.ens.fr/sierra/) team, supervised by [Francis Bach](https://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/) and [Alessandro Rudi](https://www.di.ens.fr/~rudi/). I obtained my PhD at ENSAE, Institut Polytechnique de Paris, working under the supervision of [Marco Cuturi](http://marcocuturi.net). Before that, I got an engineering degree from École polytechnique and a Msc in Data Sciences from Université Paris-Saclay. My detailed CV can be found [here](https://borismuzellec.github.io/publications/CV_website.pdf).
